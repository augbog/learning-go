# Learning Go

Just getting started with Go? Me too. I'm following some random articles. and I thought I'd share what I'm learning and, even better, how I'm learning it.

This will be clearer but the best way to use this project is to clone it where you define your `$GOPATH` which if you follow all the docs, will most likely be at `$HOME/go/src`.

# Go Installation

Nothing is better than the main docs. Installation docs:

https://golang.org/doc/install#install

# Recommended readings (in order)
